<h1>Verifying Your Bank Account</h1>

  <p>
    To verify your bank account, we are making two small deposits into that account. These are called <em>microdeposits</em>. 
    They should show up on your bank statement within 1-3 business days.
  </p>

  <p>Note the amounts, then go to your account payment settings, enter the amounts, and click verify.</p>
